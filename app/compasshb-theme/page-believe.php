	<h1>What We Believe</h1>

	<h2>THE BIBLE</h2>
	<p>The sixty-six books of the Bible were given by the inspiration of God&#8217;s Spirit and are not the product of human creativity or ingenuity (2 Pt 1:20-21). Every word of the Bible is inspired by God in the original manuscripts (2 Timothy 3:16; Mt 5:18). The Bible in its original manuscripts is without error and is completely accurate in all that it affirms (John 17:17; Ps 19:7). The Scripture is to be interpreted considering the literal, grammatical and historical aspects of a given text.</p>

	<h2>GOD THE FATHER</h2>
	<p>There is only one true and living God (Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 45:5-7; 1 Corinthians 8:4). God is one essence existing in three persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (Mt.28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14). God is sovereign (Psalm 115:3), eternal (Isaiah 44:6), all-knowing (Ps 139:4), all-powerful (Job 42:2), holy (Isaiah 6:1-7), unchanging (Malachi 3:6), just (Ps 97:2) and loving (1 John 4:8).</p>
	<hr/>

	<h2>JESUS CHRIST</h2>
	<p>Jesus is God in very essence and pre-existed as God in all His glory before His incarnation in time and space (John 8:57-58; Philippians 2:6-7). Jesus Christ became a man, virgin born (Matthew 1:23), to redeem mankind and at that time accepted all the essential characteristics of humanity without violating or detracting from His divine essence (Hebrews 2:14-15; Philippians 2:5-8). Jesus died on a cross for our sin (John 10:15; Romans 5:8; 1 Peter 2:24), was physically raised from the dead (Romans 1:4; 1 Corinthians 15:16-20), ascended to the Father (Acts 1:9; Romans 8:34), and will return to receive his church (Acts 1:9-11; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17).</p>
	<hr/>

	<h2>THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
	<p>The Holy Spirit is coequal with the Father and the Son (Matthew 28:19; Acts 5:3-4, 28:25-26; 1 Corinthians 12:4-6; 2 Corinthians 13:14). The Holy Spirit regenerates the Christian at conversion (Titus 3:5-7; John 3:3-8), places the Christian into the body of Christ at conversion (1 Corinthians 12:13), indwells the Christian at conversion (1 Corinthians 6:19), and is guarantee of the Christian&#8217;s redemption (Ephesians 1:13-14), and leads the Christian on a daily basis as he or she submits to His leadership (Galatians 5:16-25; Ephesians 5:18; Romans 8:14). The Holy Spirit is the Christian&#8217;s source of giftedness in ministering to the local church (1 Corinthians 12:7-11).</p>
	<hr/>

	<h2>PEOPLE</h2>
	<p>The human race began by the direct and instantaneous creation of God (Gen.1:26-27). Men and women are created in God&#8217;s image (Gen.1:26-27) and exist to glorify God (Is.43:7). People forfeited their intended fellowship with God (Is.59:2), incurred the penalty of spiritual and physical death (Gen.2:16-17; Rom.5:12), became subject to the wrath of God (Jn.3:36), and lost the ability to be independently acceptable to God (Rom.5:6-10) through Adam&#8217;s one act of disobedience (Rom.5:12). People exist relationally separated from God and express that sinfulness in a variety of sinful acts (Is.59:2; Rom.3:10-18).</p>
	<hr/>

	<h2>SALVATION</h2>
	<p>Salvation of individuals is wholly carried out by God&#8217;s grace, based on the redemptive work of Jesus on the cross and is in no way contributed to or accomplished by the merit or work of the individual (Eph.1:7; 2:8-10; 1 Pt.1:18-19). Those who repent and put their trust in Jesus as their provision for their sinful condition (Mk.1:15; Lk.24:46-47; Ac.3:19; 11:18; 20:21) are declared righteous by God (Rom.3:21-22; 8:33). From a human perspective one is saved after hearing the message of the gospel (Rom.10:14), being convicted by the Holy Spirit of sin (Jn.16:8-9), mentally turning from sin to God (2 Cor.7:9-11), placing one&#8217;s trust in Jesus as the complete and sole payment for sin (Jn.3:14-15). At this point God&#8217;s Spirit indwells the individual (Rom.8:9), resulting in new birth (Jn.3:3) which is often referred to as conversion (Mt.18:3; Ac.15:3; Rom.16:5). Each step in the process of salvation is granted by God including repentance and faith (Ac.11:18; Eph.2:8). The converted individual then naturally bears fruit in keeping with the internal transformation that has taken place (2 Cor.5:17; Mt.3:8; 7:17-23; Jn.3:36).</p>
	<hr/>

	<h2>THE CHURCH</h2>
	<p>The universal church is composed of all Christians from Acts 2 to the rapture and is considered the complete body of Christ (Eph.5:22-33; Mt.16:18; Jn.1:12-13). Christians gathered in geographical locations around the world with a biblical purpose (Ac.2:42-47; Phil.3:3; Heb.10:24-25; Ac.1:8), biblical leadership (Tit.1:5; 1 Tim.3; 1Pt.5:1-3), and practicing the biblical ordinances (Mt.28:19; 1Cor.11:23-26) is what the Bible most often refers to as the church—i.e. local churches (1Cor.1:2; Gal.1:2; 1Th.1:1).</p>
	<hr/>

	<h2>THE LAST THINGS</h2>
	<p>All people will be physically resurrected (Ac.24:14-15; 1 Cor.15:22-23), the saved to blessing and reward (2 Cor.4:14), the unsaved to retribution and punishment (Rev.20:13-15; Dan.12:2). God has appointed Jesus to judge the world (Jn.5:22), both Christians, concerning rewards (1 Cor.3:11-15), and non-Christians, concerning punishment (Rev.20:6, 11-15; Mt.8:12; 25:41; Rev.14:10-11; 21:8). Christ will return for his church (Ac.1:11; 1Th.4:16-17). There will be a terrible time of Tribulation (Rev.chaps.4-19). Christ will establish his kingdom (Rev.20:1-9). God will ultimately provide a new heaven and a new earth where the redeemed of God will dwell forever (Rev.21:1-22:5).</p>
