                    <p>Jesus is fully 100% God, one with the Father, but he humbled himself to be born as a man. When we
                        say the name Jesus Christ, we are not using Christ like his last name. Christ is his title. It
                        means he is the Messiah. He is the holy and anointed one of God.</p>

                    <p>The name Jesus means savior. He came down to earth on a rescue mission to seek and to save the
                        lost. People like us. We have all fallen short of the glory of God. No one besides Jesus has
                        lived perfectly up to God’s standard of holiness. Yet, Jesus paid for our sins when he died on
                        the cross in our place.</p>

                    <p>Jesus did not stay dead. On the third day, he rose again. He appeared to his disciples. There
                        were over 500 eye witnesses and some of them have written accounts in the New Testament for us
                        to read and believe today. Because Jesus rose from the dead, everyone who believes in him has a
                        new life. Not only can they live a new way now, but they know with 100% confidence they will be
                        with Jesus when they die.</p>
