        <p style="color: #ffffff;">Your child will be instructed each week by a story from the Bible. Our aim is to teach in a way that is relevant to each age group and engages your child so they are able to tell you what they learned after the service!</p>

            <h2 style="color:#ffffff;" class="tk-seravek-web">AWANA</h2>
            <p>God tells every Dad to teach his children the Bible (Deuteronomy 6:4-9 and Ephesians 6:4). Mom is
                        his ministry partner at home. Together they lead their children in how to listen to God’s
                        word.</p>
            <p><i>AWANA is a way our church can come alongside all of you who are parents of 4 year olds to 6th
                            grade.</i> We want to support what you are doing at home with this proven and effective
                        program of Bible memorization.</p>
            <p>We will always teach your children the Bible here at church, whether it is Kids ministry on
                        Sunday mornings or AWANA during the week. But AWANA provides books you can go through with your
                        child to help them memorize verses at home and hide God’s word in their heart.</p>
            <p>“I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.” ~Psalm 119:11</p>
            <p>Let’s pray God will raise up many parents who are dedicated to teaching their children the Bible
                        here at Compass HB.</p>
